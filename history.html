                <h2>The Story of Kupe</h2>
                <p>Kupe was a great Polynesian navigator who, according to Māori legend, discovered Aotearoa (New Zealand) around 1000 years ago. After spotting the long white cloud hanging over the land, Kupe and his wife Hine Te Aparangi became the first people to set foot on these shores.</p>
                
                <h2>Kupe House at Macleans College</h2>
                <p>Kupe House was established in 1981 as one of the whanau houses at Macleans College. The house mascot is the kiwi, and the house colour is <strong><u><span class="gold-colour">GOLD</span></strong></u></p>
                

                <h2>House Executives</h2>
                <p>Each year, Kupe House selects a number of senior (year 13) student executives who exemplify the values and spirit of the house. They then become the leaders of the house, and speak on every Tuesday during House Assemblies.</p>
