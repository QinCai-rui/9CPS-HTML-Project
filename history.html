                <p>Kupe was a great Polynesian navigator who, according to Māori legend, discovered Aotearoa (New Zealand) around 1000 years ago. After spotting the long white cloud hanging over the land, Kupe and his wife Hine Te Aparangi became the first people to set foot on these shores.</p>
                
                <h2>Kupe House at Macleans College</h2>
