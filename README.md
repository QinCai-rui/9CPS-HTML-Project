# Kupe House Website

This is a project/assignment for my Macleans College 09CPS course. I have made this project free and open-source on GitHub because, well, why not?

If you want to see this website in action, go to <https://kupe-house.qincai.xyz>

This project is created in two weeks, so please do not expect very high code quality.

## How does it work?

### The website (front-end) part

<https://kupe-house.qincai.xyz> is hosted on my Raspberry Pi 5 server. You can see all the source code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and assets in this GitHub repository.

### The back-end part

As you may have noticed, the client-side JS fetches resources from <https://kupe-house-api.qincai.xyz> (also hosted on my Pi). Please see <https://github.com/QinCai-rui/kupe-house-api> for more information.
